# Rusty Reef

A RaspberryPi based reef controller implemented in Rust where the outputs are fully user programmable via a tiny subset of Lisp.

## Why

I have a saltwater reef fish tank. It needs automation. I have built one using https://reef-pi.github.io/ but I don't like the UI nor do I like its lack of programability as compared with a Neptune Apex. So I wrote my own.
